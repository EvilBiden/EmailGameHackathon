# Package Structure and Compile Instructions

## Package Structure Issue

The error you're encountering is related to package structure. The error message shows classes being referenced from a `src` package (e.g., `src.GameManager`), but the original code didn't have package declarations. I've added proper package declarations to fix this issue.

## How to Organize Your Files

All Java files need to be organized in a directory structure that matches their package structure. For this application, you need to:

## Required Directory Structure

```
YourProjectFolder/
├── src/
│   ├── Email.java
│   ├── EmailDefender.java
│   ├── EmailSystem.java
│   ├── EmailViewDialog.java
│   ├── GameManager.java
│   ├── MainScreen.java
│   ├── Player.java
│   ├── UpgradeShopDialog.java
│   ├── UpgradeSystem.java
│   └── UpgradeType.java (this may be part of UpgradeSystem.java)
```

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Navigate to your project's root directory** (the folder containing the `src` directory)

2. **Compile all Java files with the correct package path**:
   ```
   javac src/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the application with the fully qualified class name**:
   ```
   java src.EmailDefender
   ```

## What Changed in the Fixed Files

I've made three major changes to fix the null pointer exception:

1. **Added package declarations**: Added `package src;` to all files to match the package structure in the error message

2. **Fixed circular dependency**: 
   - In `EmailDefender.java`: Now sets the MainScreen reference in GameManager after MainScreen is fully initialized
   - In `MainScreen.java`: Added null checks in updateUI() and updateEmailList() to prevent NullPointerException
   - In `GameManager.java`: Added code to update the UI after MainScreen is set

3. **Updated method order**: Changed the order of method calls to ensure everything is properly initialized before use

These changes should resolve the NullPointerException you were experiencing.

## Common Java Package Issues

When working with Java packages:

- Package declarations must be the first line in the file (before imports)
- Directory structure must match package structure
- When compiling and running from the command line, you need to be at the root level of the package structure
- Use fully qualified class names when running the application

If you continue to have issues, make sure all your files have the correct package declaration and that you're compiling and running from the proper directory.
